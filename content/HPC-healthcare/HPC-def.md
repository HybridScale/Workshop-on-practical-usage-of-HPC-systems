# Introduction to High-Performance Computing

## 1. From Room-Sized Machines to Life-Saving Simulations

Before diving into what *High-Performance Computing (HPC)* means today, let‚Äôs take a quick trip through time ‚Äî from the machines that filled entire rooms to the systems that help us model the human brain, predict pandemics, and design new cancer drugs.

> üí¨ **Speaker note:**  
> Open with a relatable statement:  
> ‚ÄúEvery medical CT scanner, every AI diagnostic model, every virtual drug screen ‚Äî all of them trace their roots to computing power that started growing 80 years ago.‚Äù

### 1940‚Äì1960s: The First Supercomputers  
**The birth of electronic computing**

The first ‚Äúsupercomputers‚Äù emerged during World War II. They weren‚Äôt built for medicine, but for **codebreaking, ballistics, and physics** ‚Äî yet they laid the foundation for every modern medical simulation.

- üñ•Ô∏è **ENIAC** (1945) ‚Äî the first electronic general-purpose computer, built for U.S. Army ballistics.  
- These early machines were massive ‚Äî **the size of an operating room**, consuming as much electricity as a hospital wing.  
- Their mission: **calculate faster than any human could**.

<!-- > üí¨ **Speaker note:**  
> ‚ÄúJust like medicine once relied on mechanical thermometers and hand-drawn charts, early science relied on machines like ENIAC to crunch equations that humans couldn‚Äôt handle.‚Äù -->

### 1970‚Äì1990: The Cray Era  
**When speed became a race**

In the 1970s, speed became the focus.  
Supercomputers like the **Cray-1** used *vector processors* to perform thousands of operations at once ‚Äî a breakthrough that inspired modern GPUs (used in AI today).

```{figure} ../img/Cray-1.jpg

```

<!-- > üí¨ **Speaker note:**  
> ‚ÄúBy the 1980s, HPC was no longer a military toy. It became the scientist‚Äôs microscope ‚Äî used in chemistry, fluid dynamics, and even early biological modeling.‚Äù-->

### 1990‚Äì2010: The Cluster Era  
**From super-machines to super-teams of computers**

Scientists realized that connecting *many smaller computers* could outperform one massive one ‚Äî the birth of **clusters**.

- 1994: NASA engineers built the first *Beowulf Cluster* using standard PCs and Ethernet cables.  
- This democratized HPC ‚Äî universities could now build their own ‚Äúmini supercomputers.‚Äù

```

<!-- > üí¨ **Speaker note:**  
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like assembling a hospital network ‚Äî many units working together, rather than one massive central building.‚Äù-->

---

### 2010‚ÄìPresent: The GPU & Hybrid Era  
**From physics to AI and medicine**

Today‚Äôs supercomputers combine **traditional CPUs** with **GPUs and accelerators** ‚Äî the same hardware used for medical AI, radiology, and genomics.  
Instead of a few super-fast processors, modern systems have **thousands of smaller ones working together**.

```{figure} ../img/supek-gpu-server.png
Modern HPC combines CPUs and GPUs for AI, simulations, and data analytics.
```

<!-- > üí¨ **Speaker note:**  
> ‚ÄúWe no longer chase higher clock speeds. Instead, we work smarter ‚Äî splitting the work among many processors, just as hospital teams share complex cases.‚Äù -->

## 2. What Is HPC ‚Äî and Why It Matters to You

So what exactly *is* HPC?

**High-Performance Computing (HPC)** means using **many powerful computers at once** to solve problems that are **too big, too detailed, or too urgent** for a single machine.

It‚Äôs the **engine behind modern data-driven medicine** ‚Äî where algorithms, images, and molecules meet computation.

<!-- >üí¨ **Speaker note:**  
> ‚ÄúThink of HPC as a hospital for data ‚Äî thousands of processors working together to diagnose, simulate, and predict faster than any workstation could.‚Äù-->

### HPC in Everyday Healthcare Research

Here‚Äôs how HPC touches your field, even if you don‚Äôt see it directly:

| Application | HPC‚Äôs Role |
|--------------|------------|
| **Radiology AI** | Train deep neural networks on thousands of MRI/CT scans. |
| **Drug discovery** | Simulate how molecules bind to proteins. |
| **Genomics** | Process hundreds of patient genomes in parallel. |
| **Epidemiology** | Model virus spread and hospital resource needs. |
| **Surgery planning** | Run 3D simulations of patient anatomy. |

<!-- > üí¨ **Speaker note:**  
> ‚ÄúBehind every AI paper in *The Lancet* or *Nature Medicine*, there‚Äôs almost always an HPC system doing the heavy lifting.‚Äù-->

## 3. Why Do We Need HPC?  

Most modern medical and pharmaceutical challenges are **too large for desktop computers**:

- A single CT scan can produce **hundreds of megabytes** of data.  
- One genome = **100 GB** of raw data.  
- A deep learning model might require **weeks of computation** without HPC.

### The Grand Challenges (and Opportunities)

The U.S. National Science Foundation once defined ‚Äú**Grand Challenges**‚Äù ‚Äî problems only solvable with HPC.  
Many now directly relate to healthcare and life sciences:

- Cancer detection and therapy  
- Drug design and molecular simulation  
- Climate and disease modeling  
- AI and deep learning  
- Understanding biological systems  

<!-- > üí¨ **Speaker note:**  
> ‚ÄúWe often talk about grand challenges in medicine ‚Äî curing cancer, predicting pandemics, understanding aging. HPC gives us the computational microscope to tackle them.‚Äù-->

### In One Sentence:

> üß† **HPC allows us to ask bigger questions ‚Äî and get answers faster.**

```{callout} You can:
- Solve **bigger problems in the same time**, or  
- Solve **the same problems in less time**.
```

### Reflection

```{challenge} Where could HPC help you?
Think of a task in your daily work ‚Äî an analysis, simulation, or AI model ‚Äî that you *wish* could run faster or on more data.  
Would HPC make it possible?
