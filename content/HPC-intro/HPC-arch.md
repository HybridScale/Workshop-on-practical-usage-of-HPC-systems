## Why do you need to learn the basics?
 - Hardware layout and structure matters
 - Serial computing is required for parallel programming
 - Appreciation of fundamentals will help you get more from HPC and scientific computing
 - What HPC can do and what cannot do?

## Types of HPC architecture

### CPU

### GPU

### Clusters

### Supercomputers

## Measuring the performance

### Flops

### Benchmarks

The main benchmark used for the Top500 list is the *High Performance LINPACK* ([HPL](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/)) test and is based on a variant of *LU* factorization with row partial pivoting. The main critism is that it is not representative of many important applications.

A new benchmark, called the *High Performance Conjugate Gradients* ([HPCG](https://www.hpcg-benchmark.org)) is designed to exercise computational and data access pattern that more closely match a broader set of important applications.
